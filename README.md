SCRUM Team Management Application

Inspired from my internship, I wanted to create a website that would help the organization of SCRUM teams. The locally hosted website/database manages the workload of different SPRINTS, people, and teams. The idea is to give the SCRUM team a convenient and accurate description on what the team is working on, as well as the possibility of updating the site when necessary. Ideally, the product owner, SCRUM master, and project manager would benefit the most from this application. 

I also included a file that includes the SCRUM team database schema and insert statements that were used on my website.

EPIC - As a SCRUM team member, I want to use an application to keep track of the product/sprint backlog, past/current sprints, the team's capacity, and additional information about individual team members

USER STORIES - 

For the sprint backlog, view all user stories
   - be able to filter the backlog for past due, completed, not completed
   - be able to see all the team members working on the current task

For the information panel, view the current sprint
   - be able to see what phase the current sprint is currently in (include images to make more user friendly)
   - be able to see past sprints and what the next sprint is
   - view notes for each sprint

Add new user stories, delete user stories, or transfer user stories in the sprint and product backlog

Add story points to user stories and assign user stories to team members
